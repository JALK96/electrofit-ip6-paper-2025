# electrofit Project Context and Coding Guidelines
0. **Language**: Use english when writing readme, docstring or comments.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand and critically evaluate the directory layout and the purpose of each folder (e.g., `core/`, `infra/`, `adapters/`, `domain/`, `pipeline/`, `viz/`).

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow PEP 8 for Python code style. Use meaningful variable and function names, and include docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling using exceptions. Avoid using bare `except` clauses; always specify the exception type.

4. **Logging**: Use the logging module for all logging purposes. Avoid using print statements for debugging or logging.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes. Follow the testing conventions used in the project (e.g., pytest).

6. **Documentation**: Update the documentation (e.g., docstrings, README.md) to reflect any changes made to the codebase.

7. **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews by providing constructive feedback and being open to suggestions.

8. **Dependencies**: Manage project dependencies using a requirements.txt file or similar. Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies.

9. **Comments**: Keep components small and focused. Use comments to explain the "why" behind complex logic, and avoid obvious comments that state the "what".
